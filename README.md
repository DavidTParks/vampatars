## Acknowledgements
-  [Des Lucrece](https://deslucrece.com/) I love Des' artwork, specifically his [BitMON](https://objkt.com/profile/8bit.lucrece/created) collection which provided a way for me to remix his base artwork into the vampire avatars for Vamp. If you love his work go check it out. Buying a piece gives you the full rights to the artwork to do as you please with it.
